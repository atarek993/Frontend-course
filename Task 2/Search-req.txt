1- Semantic Tags
Semantic tags are elements that clearly describe their meaning in a way that both the browser and the developer can understand like :
<header>: Represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
<nav>: Defines a set of navigation links. It is commonly used for menus or a set of navigation links within a website.

<section>: Represents a standalone section of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it. It is used to group related content.

<article>: Specifies independent, self-contained content, such as a blog post, news article, or any other content that could be distributed and reused independently.

<aside>: Contains content that is tangentially related to the content around it, often used for sidebars or pull quotes.

<footer>: Represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. It typically contains author information, copyright information, or links to related documents.

<main>: Specifies the main content of the document, excluding content repeated across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, or footers.

<figure>: Used to encapsulate media content like images, illustrations, diagrams, or code snippets, often with a caption using the <figcaption> element.

<figcaption>: Provides a caption or explanation for the content in the <figure> element.

<time>: Represents a specific period in time, such as a date, time, or both. It can be useful for event scheduling or timestamps in blogs.


2-Span

The <span> tag in HTML is a non-semantic, inline container used to group and style pieces of text or other inline elements. Unlike semantic tags such as <header> or <article>, the <span> tag does not convey any specific meaning or structure to the content it wraps. Instead, itâ€™s often used in combination with CSS or JavaScript to apply styles or manipulate the DOM.

3-Div

The <div> tag in HTML is a block-level container used to group elements together, often for styling or scripting purposes. Unlike some HTML tags that convey specific meaning or structure, <div> is a non-semantic element, meaning it doesn't inherently represent anything about the content it contains. It's primarily used to divide sections of a webpage and apply styles or scripts to those sections.

4-Opt group
The <optgroup> tag in HTML is used to group related options within a <select> dropdown list. This is especially useful when you have a long list of options and want to categorize them into different groups for better organization and readability.
ex:
a-
<select name="cars">
    <optgroup label="German Cars">
        <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
        <option value="bmw">BMW</option>
        <option value="audi">Audi</option>
    </optgroup>
    <optgroup label="Japanese Cars">
        <option value="toyota">Toyota</option>
        <option value="honda">Honda</option>
        <option value="nissan">Nissan</option>
    </optgroup>
</select>
In this example, the <optgroup> tags group the options into "German Cars" and "Japanese Cars," making the dropdown more organized.
